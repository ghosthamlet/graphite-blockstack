## Graphite

Graphite is a decentralized writing app build on [Blockstack](http://blockstack.org). The app never stores your identity or any of your data. You own your files, you choose what to share (Blockstack [multireader](link) storage coming soon for collaboration).

Think of Graphite as a privacy-focused replacement for Google Docsâ€”something that lets you own your writing.

Check it out at http://app.graphitedocs.com

Graphite was created and maintained by [Justin Hunter](http://justin-hunter.com), but is open source and available for contributions.

## Install

Graphite is open source and welcomes new issues, feature requests, and contributions.

Steps to install:

1) Clone the repo or fork it and clone your fork.
2) Run 'npm install'
3) Run 'npm run start'
4) Have fun!

## Motivation

This project stemmed from the increasing control companies place on user data. At any given moment, Google can remove access to every single one of the documents you write and store with them. That's unacceptable.

Graphite sets out to change that, and this was only possible because of the work done by Blockstack.
